## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from BRAC University, passionate about web development, machine learning, network engineering, and app development. I love exploring new technologies, solving real-world problems, and building innovative solutions.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Dart, Flutter, and advanced machine learning concepts.
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on developing mobile apps and integrating ML models into applications.
ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on open-source projects and AI-driven applications.
ðŸŽ® In my free time, I enjoy playing games, watching anime and movies, and exploring new tech.
